Josh Dotfiles!
==============

*TOTALLY UNTESTED!!!*

I thought it was finally time to SCM my dots.

Installing?
===========

      git clone git://github.com/sivad77/dotfiles ~/projects/dotfiles
      cd ~/projects/dotfiles
      ./dotfiles

This will backup all target `.dotfiles` to a backup folder in the project.

What now?
=========
Nothing to see here, please move along...
